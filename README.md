# Python Basics – Learning Repository

This repository documents my self-learning and revision process in the fundamentals of Python. 
As an Artificial Intelligence undergraduate student, Python is a core language in my academic 
path, and building strong fundamentals is essential before progressing to machine learning 
and AI-focused development.

This repository serves as a structured space for consistent practice, reinforcing core 
Python concepts, and maintaining fluency in the language through repetition and hands-on 
exercises.
