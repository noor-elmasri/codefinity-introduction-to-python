# Python Basics – Learning Repository

This repository contains my self-learning journey in the fundamentals of Python. 
I have already learned the basic concepts of Python, and this repository serves as 
a way to review those fundamentals and maintain consistent practice.

The focus of this repository is to reinforce core concepts through repetition,
practice exercises, and small examples.
